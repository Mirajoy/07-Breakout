# 07-Breakout
This is the sixth assignment for ILS-Z399: the classic game of breakout. Originally built by Steve Wozniak (and aided by Steve Jobs), this has been an arcade classic since 1976.

This version of breakout should be working, but it is pretty boring. Your assignment is to make it "juicy": use your creativity and the tools we have been talking about in class to make it more fun to play.

I have tried to leave you some hooks into which you can inject your code, but let me know if you run into trouble. Here are some resources that might help:

* [Juice it or lose it - a talk by Martin Jonasson & Petri Purho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg)
* [Easing Equations in Python (orig by Robert Penner)](https://gist.github.com/th0ma5w/9883420)
* [PyGame Tutorial: Working with Images](http://www.nerdparadise.com/programming/pygame/part2)
* [PyGame Tutorial: Music and Sound Effects](http://www.nerdparadise.com/programming/pygame/part3)
* [pygame shaking window when losing lives](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23633339/pygame-shaking-window-when-loosing-lifes)
* [Some pygame examples for you to play with](https://github.com/ILS-Z399/pygame-examples)
* [Degrees and Radians](https://www.quia.com/jg/321176list.html)

To complete this assignment you will need to understand:

* Python Classes, objects, and other data structures
* The pygame game engine

I changed the screen size and paddle position so it would fit on my screen. I started to implement a difficulty system.
